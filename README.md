Unboxing/Build Guide
The manual and a copy of the printer files can be found on the included thumb drive in your box. Look carefully as you unbox and don't accidently toss it. If you did you can download the release package for the lastest official printer config files.

Installation 

WARNING: Be sure to modify the MCU_serial.cfg with your own unique MCU Serial ID. Your printer will not function properly if you do not. Early shipments of the Marathon did not include the MCU_serial.cfg file in the package, so you may need to find your MCU_Serial ID and update the MCU_serial file with your own unique id. 

Replacement Parts

Print files for printer parts can be found in the "printer parts" folder.
